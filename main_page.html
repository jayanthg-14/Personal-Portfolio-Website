                            I'm a passionate <span>Front-end Developer</span> focused on creating intuitive, detail-oriented user interfaces that combine thoughtful design with clean code. My strongest work emerges from the intersection of technical implementation and user experience, building web applications that prioritize both visual appeal and functional excellence.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Currently, I'm focused on front-end development with expertise in <span>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap framework</span>. I bring a meticulous approach to every project, ensuring pixel-perfect implementations that meet modern web standards. My technical foundation extends to data structures, algorithms, and Python programming, complemented by certifications in Java full-stack development.
                            <br><br>
                            My interest in technology began in childhood through early exposure to computing, which cultivated my natural problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. This foundation has evolved into a focused pursuit of user interface design, where I can leverage both creative vision and technical precision to craft exceptional digital experiences.
                            <br><br>
                            I'm actively expanding my skill set through <span>Full-stack Development</span> studies and exploring <span>AI tools</span> to enhance development workflows. Through hands-on project work, I continuously refine my abilities while building practical applications that demonstrate my commitment to quality and innovation.
                            <br><br>

                            In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal coding projects, and staying current with design trends that shape the future of web development.

                        <span class="h1">Personal Portfolio Website</span><br><br>Building this portfolio website was an exciting journey where I got to showcase my technical skills while creating something truly personal. I developed the entire site from scratch using <span>HTML5, CSS3</span>, and <span>vanilla JavaScript</span>, which gave me complete control over every detail. The most challenging and rewarding part was implementing the interactive <span>Canvas API animations</span> for the navigation - those smooth line extensions on hover took some creative <span>problem-solving</span>, but the end result feels really polished and engaging.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What I'm most proud of is how I combined my technical abilities with thoughtful design choices to create a user experience that actually feels good to navigate. The split-screen layout with smooth scrolling, the carefully chosen dark theme, and the responsive <span>Flexbox positioning</span> all work together to tell my story as a developer. Through this project, I demonstrated my skills in <span>DOM manipulation, event handling</span>, and creating clean, organized code architecture. It's more than just a portfolio - it's proof that I can take an idea from concept to completion while maintaining professional web standards and creating something that genuinely represents who I am as a developer.
